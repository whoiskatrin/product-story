# Roadmap Component

A reusable roadmap component for displaying a product roadmap on your website

## Installation

You can install the package using npm:

```bash
npm install roadmap-component
```

Usage
To use the roadmap component, import it into your project:

jsx
Copy code
import MyRoadmapComponent from 'my-roadmap-component';

const roadmapData = [
{ title: 'Q1 2023', description: 'Launch MVP' },
{ title: 'Q2 2023', description: 'Introduce premium features' },
// Add more roadmap items...
];

function App() {
return (
<div>
<h1>My Product Roadmap</h1>
<MyRoadmapComponent data={roadmapData} />
</div>
);
}

export default App;
The data prop expects an array of objects, where each object represents a roadmap item with a title and description.

Customization
You can customize the appearance of the roadmap component by passing CSS styles as props. Here's an example:

jsx
Copy code
const roadmapStyle = {
backgroundColor: 'lightgray',
padding: '1rem',
borderRadius: '4px',
};

<MyRoadmapComponent data={roadmapData} style={roadmapStyle} />
Feel free to modify the CSS properties to match your design requirements.
